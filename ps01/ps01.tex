\section{Task 1}

The energy equation is

\begin{equation}
	\partial_t (\rho E) + \div{\rho H \u} = \div{\tau \cdot \u} + \div{(k\grad{T}}+ \rho \vec{f} \cdot \u
\end{equation}

If we assume that there is no mass flow, that is $\u = 0$, then all terms involving $\u$ will disappear. This leaves us with

\begin{equation}
	\partial_t (\rho E) = + \div{(k\grad{T}}
\end{equation}

Assuming a 1D system this transforms to

\begin{equation}
	\partial_t (\rho E) = + \partial_x{(k\partial_t{T}}
\end{equation}

As we have assumed that $\u=0$ there is no kinetic energy in the specific energy $E$, and we have $E = e$ where is the specific internal energy (internal energy per unit mass). The change in specific internal energy is related to the change in temperature by the specific heat capacity, $dd{e} = c_p \dd{T}$.

Since $\u = 0$ then $\partial_t \rho = 0$ (or we could assume incompressible). If in addition we assume homogenous $k$ we get

\begin{equation}
	\rho\partial_t (E) = + \partial_x{(k\partial_t{T}}
\end{equation}

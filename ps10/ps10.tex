\section{Task 1}

\subsection{a)}

The 2D energy equation for a convective flow including heat conduction is

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:energy2d}
\partial_x{(\rho c_p T u)} + \partial_y{(\rho c_p T v)} = \partial_x(k\partial_x T) + \partial_y(k\partial_y T)
\end{equation}

We assume that $v=0$, i.e. only convection in the $u$-direction. We integrate the (\ref{eq:energy2d}) over a rectangular control volume with edges along coordinate axes and unit length in the $z$-direction.

\begin{equation}
\Delta y \left[ (\rho c_p Tu)_e - (\rho c_p Tu)_w \right]= \Delta y \left[(k\partial_x T)_e - (k \partial_x T)_w \right] + \Delta x \left[(k\partial_y T)_n - (k \partial_y T)_s \right]
\end{equation}

We approximate face values of $T$ by linear interpolation and derivatives by central differences to yield

\begin{equation}
F_e \frac{T_E + T_P}{2} - F_w \frac{T_P + T_W}{2} = D_e(T_E-T_P) - D_w(T_P-T_W) + D_n(T_N-T_P) - D_s(T_P-T_S).
\end{equation}

Where we have introduce $ F = \rho u A$ and $ D = \frac{k A}{c_p \delta x}$. Note $A = \Delta x \cdot 1$ and similarly for $\Delta y$. Now group terms with $T_i$

\begin{equation}
(F_e - F_w + D_e + D_w + D_n + D_s) T_P = (D_e - F_e) T_E + (D_w+F_w) T_w + D_n T_N - D_s T_P.
\end{equation}

The continutity equation is 

\begin{equation}
\partial_x \rho u = 0
\end{equation}

Integrating over a control volume we get

\begin{equation}
(\rho u)_e - (\rho u)_w  = F_e - F_w = 0
\end{equation}

We can therefore simplify to

\begin{equation}
(D_e + D_w + D_n + D_s) T_P = (D_e - F_e) T_E + (D_w+F_w) T_w + D_n T_N - D_s T_P.
\end{equation}

This holds for the interior points.

\subsection{b)}

Western convective flux just use Ta directly. 
For the diffusive flux use Ta but dx/2, same for souther and norhtern fluxes.

For the left boundary we assume fixed temperature that extends to the left, thus the above equation can be used by just replacing $T_W = T_a$. This would place the boundary at $-\Delta x$. Alternatively we can just used the western flux and modifiy the delta x at the boundary.

We will assume that at the right boundary we have von Neuman boundary conditions, i.e. no temperature gradient in the y-direction, indicating the the flow has reached a steady state. This can be checke by changing the length of the simulation domain and ensuring that temperature does not change at the initial right boundary.

Ie Tb = TP

\subsection{c}

The numerical solution to the system was determined using the code shown at the end of this document. The steady state temperature distribution is shown in figure \ref{fig:temp-c}. We see that at the right half, the temperature gradient is small which indicates that our approximation of zero temperatur flux at this side seems valid. The high temperature at the inlet is convected by the parabolic velocity distribution but is gradually decreased as the thermal energy is diffused to the lower boundary. At the right side we have a consant temperature gradient  and heat flux from the upper to the lower plate.

\subsection{d)}
Figure \ref{fig:nusselt-d} shows the nusselt number for the two walls (sign has been flipped for one for ease of comparison). As can be seen from the figure, the nusselt number is initally high, implying that the convective convective flux is high due to the heat from the high temperature inlet being convected down the pipe. Further down, the effect of the high temperature inlet is reduced and the temperature flux is primarily due to diffusion, resulting in a low Nusselt number.

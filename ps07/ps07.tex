\section{Task 1}

\subsection{a)}
The term $\dfrac{\partial y}{\partial t}$ indicates that in the $y$-direction $u$ is convected in the positive $y$-direction, confer the advection equation with a positive convection velocity of 1,

\begin{equation}
\partial_t + \partial_y = 0
\end{equation}

Since the conserved quantity is convected out of the $y=1$ plane, no boundary condition is necessary, the values at the boundary is determined by values at $y<1$.
